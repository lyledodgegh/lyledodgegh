I'm an x-integration consultant with a varied background across lots of technology and business roles - from data center management, database administration, packaged software engineering, website development, software release engineering, across on premises and Azure, to business manager / chief of staff, and go to market development. I've worked in companies spanning many industries - manufacturing, financial services, public sector, technology consulting services,  web design, and health care. I've spent time in all sizes of companies from 25 people up to my current employer, Microsoft. I've enjoyed being an individual contributor, a manager and a manager of managers. My classical education is a BS in Computer Science from Kettering University and an MBA from the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.

I'm passionate about leading teams working on solving customer problems, where a technology, architecture, and often business mix together, and I love doing a bit of evangelism along the way.

In my current role in the Applications + Infrastructure Strategy Team in Microsoft WorldWide Commercial Business, I'm responsible for the following:

- Cloud Native Global Blacks - servant leader, year over year role design (function, measurement, compensation)
- Linux + Cloud Native Strategy Lead - forward looking investments around the Linux stack + ecosystem on Azure, select ISV sales partnerships
- Sales strategy, customer escalations, field enablement (both Microsoft and Red Hat) for Azure Red Hat OpenShift
- Collaboration with Microsoft's Open Source Programs office on key internal initiatives across the Sales + Engineering organizations
- Partner with the broader App Specialist community in the Specialist Team Unit (front half of typical sales pipeline) and the Cloud Solution Architect community in the Customer Success Unit (back half of the typical sales pipeline).
- In my spare time I evangelize the work that our field engineers do for customers in my [Azure in the Enterprise](https://azureintheenterprise.com/) channel on YouTube, with select videos published to the [Azure in the Enterprise playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLasX02E8BPDwxoN1T18bYfbzGwP555rR) on the main [Azure YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/windowsazure).

While I've been at Microsoft, I've had a few other roles as well, and here's some of the things I have done:

- 4 Year Microsoft Executive Briefing Center Performance Excellence Winner - 189.9 NSAT across 149 Briefings influencing $1.405B in customer pipeline. The only topic I cover is Microsoft's own internal IT engineering organization's transformation from 42k+ on premises servers across multiple data centers to Azure, including the engineering system changes, people and org changes, financial decisions, and cultural change.
- Created and ran a week long depth workshop focused on the adoption of Azure within large enterprises for external customers, specifically face to face sessions to accelerate customer's adoption of Azure with regards to governance, devops, networking, security, manageability, operations, software engineering and more.
- Speaking at Microsoft Build 2018, Red Hat Summit 2019, and multiple internal conferences (Microsoft Ready).
