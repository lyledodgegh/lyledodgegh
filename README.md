I'm an x-integration consultant with a varied background across lots of technology and business roles - from data center management, database administration, packaged software engineering, website development, software release engineering, across on premises and Azure, to business manager / chief of staff, and go to market development. I've worked in companies spanning many industries - manufacturing, financial services, public sector, technology consulting services,  web design, and health care. I've spent time in all sizes of companies from 25 people up to my current employer, Accenture. I've enjoyed being an individual contributor, a manager and a manager of managers. My classical education is a BS in Computer Science from Kettering University and an MBA from the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.

I'm passionate about leading teams working on solving customer problems, where a technology, architecture, and often business mix together, and I love doing a bit of evangelism along the way.
